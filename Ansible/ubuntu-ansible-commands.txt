# Install Ansible
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible

# Add in hosts
sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts  

[servers]

# Save this file and the we test it if we have added them properly.
ansible-inventory --list -y

# Next part is the Key gen:
ssh-keygen -t rsa

#Enter file in which to save the key (/home/tecmint/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter key]
#Created directory '/home/tecmint/.ssh'.
#Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press enter key]
#Enter same passphrase again: [Press enter key]

# Copy key to the two servers
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@centos1.dcloud.cisco.com 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'  -----> this command shud always runs in this path '/home/tecmint/.ssh/id_rsa'

# Make sure to change directory to home directory before creating
cd ~
pwd

# Ideally after this we should be able to login into centos1 & 2 without password!
ssh root@centos1.dcloud.cisco.com

# Shouldn't ask password
exit
ssh root@centos2.dcloud.cisco.com

# Then we check for ping-pong
ansible all -m ping -u root

# Once the connection is established we proceed for playbook!

# Check for our hosts

cat /etc/ansible/hosts

# Then add our hosts inventory file

# Also before running ansible we have to create a hosts file with our host IP.

vi hosts 

[webserver_1]
198.18.134.49
[webserver_2]
198.18.134.50

# Then our create playbook and nginx files

sudo vi nginx-install.yml 

# Playbook is located in an separate file labeled nginx-install.yml 
# Testing 
cat nginx-install.yml
# checking if yum module is installed
yum list installed | grep nginx 
sudo apt-get install yum 

# Create html file index.html.j2
mkdir templates
cd templates
vi index.html.j2

<html>
  <center><h1> Hello World! this is {{ ansible_hostname }} </h1>
  </center>
</html>

# Running playbook (go back to main directory using cd ~) 

ansible-playbook -i hosts nginx-install.yml --check

# Go to centos1 and check the version of nginx

ssh root@198.18.134.49
nginx -V

# After successful deploying, now to undeploy write another yml file.

sudo vi nginx-uninstall.yml 

# Playbook is located in an separate file labeled nginx-uninstall.yml 

ansible-playbook -i hosts nginx-uninstall.yml

# Now once again check the centos1 version of nginx if it is still available!
# and we are doonnneeeee !
